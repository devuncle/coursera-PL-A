这是本课程的第二部分，讲解Racket语言。
The first few topics cover basic Racket programming since we need to introduce Racket before we start using it to study more advanced concepts. We will do this quickly because (a) we have already seen a similar language and (b) The Racket Guide, http://docs.racket-lang.org/guide/index.html, and other documentation at http://racket-lang.org/ are excellent and free.

简要的介绍是这个网址：https://docs.racket-lang.org/quick/index.html
